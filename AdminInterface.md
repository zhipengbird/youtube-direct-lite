# Introduction #

Once the YouTube Direct Lite submissions start coming in, you'll want to moderate them so that you can feature the videos you like in playlists hosted in your own account. Alternatively, if a video is submitted that you don't like, you can mark it as being rejected so that it gets cleared out of your queue of videos that are pending moderation.

# Choosing a Playlist #

Video submissions are associated with a specific playlist, and when moderating submissions, you first have to choose the playlist you're interested in.

If you're using the ReferenceImplementation, visit http://ytdirectlite.appspot.com/static-min/admin.html, or if you're HostingYourOwnInstance, visit your local copy of `admin.html`. Next, choose a specific playlist in your account, or create a new playlist as desired.

# Embed Codes #

On the playlist-specific page, you'll see a number of tabs. One tab provides a series of important links tailored for that playlistâ€”a link to the YouTube Direct Lite embed code to use for soliciting videos into that playlist, a link to an embeddable playlist player that will display videos that have been added to that playlist, and a link to an RSS feed that is updated when new videos are submitted.

# Moderation #

You'll also see a number of tabs used for moderation.
