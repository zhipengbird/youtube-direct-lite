# Introduction #

If you include the reference implementation of YouTube Direct Lite on your page, then you don't need to download or configure anything. You'll add the YouTube Direct Lite submission widget by including a specific iframe HTML tag anywhere on your existing web pages.

# Details #

The iframe to include will be of the form `<iframe width="420" height="500" src="http://ytdirectlite.appspot.com/static-min/index.html#playlist="></iframe>`, with the `playlist` paramater to the id of a playlist in your YouTube account. Rather than manually constructing this iframe code, please visit the admin interface as described in the next section, and use that to generate the correct code for a given playlist.

# Next Steps #

Learn about accessing the AdminInterface so that you can generate an iframe embed code, as well as moderate videos that have been submitted.
